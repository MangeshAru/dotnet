# dotnet
Dotnet framework is a software development framework provide predefined function so it is easy to use.
It includes a library and runtime environment.
FCL (Framework Class Library) provides user interface, database connectivity, cryptography, web development and many more.
.NET programs are executed in CLR (Common Language Runtime).
Provide language interoperability i.e., provides many languages which combine altogether.

### Advantages
   Object-oriented programming
   Language independence
   Efficient data access
   Code Sharing 
   Support for services

## Compilation Process
   It is done in two parts
    1.	Language compilers – compiler time process
    2.	JIT – runtime process
    
Compiler time process
    The .NET framework has one or more language compilers in which source code(ex: abc.exe file) is compiled by respective compiler(converted to abc.EXE) and translate source code into MSIL code (it also contains meta data) usually EXE and DLL (Dynamic Link Libraries) file.
Runtime Process
       CLR includes a JIT compiler for converting MSIL code into native code and that is then executed by OS.
